Meow Finder is an app developed using Jetpack Compose and its main goal is to provide a way for people for finding cats up for adoption.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
The 3 first cats on the home screen are my own cats. And my main motivation to create this app came from them and from the love that I have for cats.

I am very proud of the results I had using Jetpack Compose when creating this app. I am more familiar with it now.
